# PAH_Plant_Annotation_Hackaton_PT
Annotating field and laboratory datasets for plant data
This is a cooperative exercise initiated by Pedro Fernandes and Mario Silva, an initiative of the portuguese participation in EXCELERATE WP7, "Integrating Genomic and Phenotypic Data for Crop and Forest Plants"
Our aim is to get acquainted with alternative methods of adding annotation to existing plant datasets of several types and share the results. 
The outcomes of this hackaton will be:
- user accessible annotated datasets incorporating phenotypic data and metadata, together with genotypic data.
- data repositories resulting from these datasets
- descriptions of the methods used in the above processes
- simple written instructions for general use of the type "How to..."
- reports with hints on ways to maintain and explore the new repositories

# Resources #
- data (list, mock, reduced datasets, selected for this exercise)

- ontologies (list)

- tools (list)

- literature (list)


# Methods #
To add the annotation
- using Google spreadsheets and possibly add-ons like OntoMaton
- using drop down lists
To export the speadsheets to other formats (CSV? TSV?)
To maniupulate tables in standardise formats (ISA-tab)
To build repositories and maintain them (ISA-bii)
To manipulate and merge repositories
